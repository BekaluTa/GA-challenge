### Step 2: Validate your understanding


### Step 4: Test yourself

Try to solve a basic optimization problem with what you have learned, here is the problem.
A van in a shop must be filled to transport household appliances, its load must be optimized by maximizing the value of what is transported for a given volume. You have a file with occupied space, price and quantity of certain products (file at https://github.com/Ishikawa7/Quick-paths-to-start/tree/main/Genetic%20algorithms/Step%204). Test for variable free space values, for example between 1 and 5.

##### Feel free to skip to this step and try the test
